# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise wants to know how different campaings compared to each other with raising money regarding their launch date and funding goals.
I am turning data into words for Louise so we can tell her what was effective and suggestions for future campaigns. 
I created some visuals based on laucnh date and funding goals so she can better understand the data and remeber what was successful and not so successful. 

### Purpose
Telling Louis what the data means to help her make more educated decisions on future campaings to get the most out of them. 

## Analysis and Challenges
One of the challenges I had with this data set was I was accidentally counting the number of campaings who riased $1000 twice so my numbers were off. 
It took me a little bit before I realized I had a mistake in one of my formulas, but once I fixed it, the numbers matched and I continued. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
According to the graph that is in the Outcomes based on launch data, Louise's best time period for running theater campaigns is Arpil-August. 
With the exception of February, the other months are significantly lower in the number of successful theater campaigns. 
According to the graph, it looks like the number of successful and failed theater campaigns have a slightly positive correlation. 
The number of canceled campaigns does not seem to have any correlation with the number of successful or failed theater campaigns.
Below is the link to the graph that I made:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
There is a strong negative correlation between percentage successful and percentage failed for plays raising money. 
Louise has a strong success rate with play campaigns that have goals of less than $5,000. 
After that there is a steady decline of success rate until the goal hits $25,000 goal range. 
There is a strong dip in success rate after that threshold. 
Then there is a strong increase in success rate at the $35,000-$39,999 range. 
Her success rate evens out between the goal range of $35,000-$44,999 at 67%
Then there is a sharp decline once the goal hits $45,000 to a 0% success rate. 
There is a slight increase in success rate for the play campaigns with the goal over $50,000.
The higher success rate she has, the lower her failure rate is and vice versa. 
There are were no plays that were canceled. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only difficulty I encoutnered was a mistake that I made with one of my formluas. 
I was counting campaigns that had a goal of $1,000 twice so when i doubled checked if my numbers matched, they did not. 
It took me a little while before I realzied that one of my formulas was incorrect. 
Fixed it, then the numbers matched. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
That May is the month with the most successful campaigns. 
Summer seems to be the best season for successful campaigns. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There is a negative correlation between successful and failed campaigns. 
There were no play campaigns that were canceled. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We did not collect the data so there could be some inaccuracies in the data that Louise provided. 
The US has by far the largest sample size. 
If you wanted a true perspective on all of the countires that are included in the dataset, each country would need ample campaigns done in that country. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Line chart of percent of successful, failed and canceled campaigns per country. 
Line chart of percent of successful, failed and canceled campaigns for each parent and subcategory
A bar chart of what kind of campaigns were the most successful.
